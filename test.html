        <h4 class="style-subheading">Our User Acceptance plan was designed to ensure that our Treasure Hunt web application meets the needs and expectations of our target users. The plan consisted of the following steps:</h4>

        <ul class="style-list">
            <li>Define user requirements: We gathered information about our target users and their needs, preferences, and expectations for a treasure hunt web application. This helped us to identify the key features and functionalities that our app should include.</li>
            <li>Develop test scenarios: Based on the user requirements, we developed a set of test scenarios that covered all the key features and functionalities of our app. These scenarios were designed to simulate real-world usage of the app and to test its performance under various conditions.</li>
            <li>Conduct user testing: We invited a group of target users to participate in the user testing process. They were asked to complete the test scenarios using our app and to provide feedback on their experience. This allowed us to identify any issues or areas for improvement in the app.</li>
            <li>Analyse test results: We analysed the results of the user testing, including the feedback provided by the participants. This helped us to identify any patterns or trends in the issues encountered and to prioritize the areas for improvement.</li>
            <li>Implement improvements: Based on the analysis of the test results, we made the necessary improvements to our app. This included fixing any bugs or issues, as well as making enhancements to the user interface and overall user experience.</li>
            <li>Repeat testing and analysis: We conducted additional rounds of user testing and analysis to ensure that the improvements made to our app were effective and that no new issues had been introduced.</li>
            <li>Finalize the app: Once we were satisfied that our app met the needs and expectations of our target users, we finalized the app and prepared it for release.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Overall, our Treasure Hunt web application performed well in meeting the needs and expectations of our target users, as demonstrated by the positive feedback received during user testing. By addressing the areas for improvement identified through Nielsen's Heuristics, we can further enhance the user experience and ensure the continued success of our app.</h4>

        <h4>The Treasure Hunt App uses the user's location, QR scanner, and map pathway to enhance the gameplay experience. Here's a brief overview of each feature:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Location: The app uses the user's geolocation to determine their position and provide location-based hints and challenges. This adds an element of exploration and adventure to the game, as users must physically visit specific locations to find clues and solve puzzles. The app uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to access the user's location data, and the Leaflet library to display the user's path on a map.</li>
            <li>QR Scanner: The app includes a QR code scanner that allows users to scan QR codes to reveal hidden information or submit answers to questions. This adds an interactive element to the game, as users must search for and scan QR codes to progress through the treasure hunt. The app uses the Instascan library to implement the QR code scanner functionality.Â </li>
            <li>Map Pathway: As users progress through the treasure hunt, their path is displayed on a map using the Leaflet library. This provides a visual representation of the user's journey and allows them to see the locations they have visited during the game. The map also displays markers for each location, with tooltips showing the order in which the locations were visited.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>These features work together to create an engaging and immersive gameplay experience, encouraging users to explore their surroundings and solve challenging puzzles to complete the treasure hunt.</h4>
