    Welcome to our Treasure Hunt web application! Our team has developed a unique online quiz that will challenge
    your knowledge and sense of adventure. With our application, you will have the opportunity to explore different
    locations and find hidden clues to unravel the mystery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our web app is designed to be user-friendly and reliable, with easy navigation and clear instructions to guide
    you through the game. To start playing, simply register and select Treasure Hunt. Each hunt has a set of questions
    that require you to search for information in specific locations. You can submit your answers online and earn points
    for correct answers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our application uses this API appropriately to access hints and compete by submitting responses. We also tested
    the app with a test API that offers practice treasure hunts with questions and fake grades. This ensures that our
    app is of the highest quality and offers our users a seamless experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    To promote our app, we have created a special landing page that introduces our project and team. We have designed
    the page in such a way as to promote our application to the public, with clear information about the application
    and its features. We have also integrated our social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to reach a wider audience
    and encourage participation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our team is committed to providing an exceptional online quiz that will challenge and inspire our users. We invite
    you to join us on this adventure and start exploring the world with our Treasure Hunt web application.
